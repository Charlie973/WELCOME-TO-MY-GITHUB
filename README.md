# üí´ About Me:
Hello, I'm Charles, a junior Computer Science major at NJIT with a passion for web development and learning new programming stacks.<br><br>Fun fact: I love traveling and experiencing different cultures. Whenever I visit a new place, I try to pick up some of the local language and practice with native speakers.<br><br>Currently, I'm working on a website called Finally Fluent, which helps people from around the world connect and learn languages together. It's an exciting project that combines my interests in web development and language learning.<br><br>One of my favorite projects on my GitHub profile is a gaming website that I built using PHP, HTML, JS, and SQL. The website features user registration, token system, and a simple yet fun Invader Space game. It was a challenging project, but I enjoyed every bit of it.<br><br>In my spare time, I'm constantly learning more about web development and exploring new programming stacks. I'm particularly interested in React and Node.js at the moment.<br><br>Thanks for stopping by my profile! Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or just want to chat about web development, language learning, or travel.
